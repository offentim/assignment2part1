/**
 * This class should handle the FFT operations for you. To use it, declare a single instance of it and then call its fft()
 * method whenever you need some data to be processed.
 *
 * A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processes signals for you and extracts any underlying frequencies within potentially noisy data;
 * for example, if you took the audio signal from a piece of music and ran it through an FFT you could figure out every single
 * note that is being played at any one time. In our case we use it to get rid of noise in our sensor readings; noise shouldn't have
 * a constant frequency and so won't show up once the readings have been processed.
 *
 * This FFT has a window size associated with it, which you have to declare when you construct it. This window size has to be a
 * power of two otherwise your app will crash.
 *
 * When you call the the fft() method you give it the data you want processed. Each value should be a constant time
 * period apart; for example, each could be readings from your sensor taken exactly a second apart. Once the method
 * returns, the results will be stored in the same arrays that you used to pass the data into the method. This data will
 * now be in the frequency domain, which sounds fancy but all that means is that one of your graph axes will now be
 * specific frequencies rather than specific points in time. High values in any array index then means that there was
 * a lot of that specific frequency present in your input data; e.g. if x[1] is high then there was a 1Hz frequency
 * present in your data.
 *
 * I know this is all very confusing so I'd highly recommend having a look at this video which explains it in visual terms:
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY
 * You don't need to know exactly how the maths works, you just need to know how to work with it. So don't worry too much
 * about the details.

     *        (i.e. your accelerometer values). After the method returns it will contain the real part of
     *        the result of the FFT; this is the part you actually care about and is what you should be plotting.

     *        contain some useful information if you want to look deeper though so I've left it in in changes
